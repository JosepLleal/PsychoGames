# X-Multiply

XMultiply is a side-scrolling shooter published by Irem, and similar in style to their earlier R-Type. In 1998, the game was released with Image Fight as a one-disc doublebill on PlayStation and Sega Saturn. Instead of the Force pod, however, the main power-up apparatus takes the form of two flexible tentacles.

## Plot:
The game centers around an unusual alien invasion against a colony planet in the year 2249-the aliens themselves are microscopic creatures that invade, infect, and kill the colonists. Scientists have deployed the microscopic fighter X-002 into the body of the hapless woman whose body has been invaded by the alien queen.
