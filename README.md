# X-Multiply

X-Multiply is a side-scrolling shooter game, similar in style to R-Type, developed by Irem and released in 1989 and later in 1998 for Sega Saturn and Playstation. X-Multiply has 7 stages each one with a different boss.

In this game, microscopic aliens invade a colony planet in the year 2249, infesting humans with themselves. 
To combat the alien queen which is currently residing in a human female, a group of scientists 
construct the X-002, a microscopic fighter ship, which is controlled by the player and its aim is to reach the final stage to end with the plague.
